# Description
 Cafe-Hopper is an app designed for coffee lovers that are looking for different cafes for different days. Not only can users add new coffee shops they stumble upon, but they can also CREATE and READ their insightful reviews, DELETE existing ones, and highlight distinctive features that define each cafe's character, enabling others to make informed choices. Furthermore, Cafe-Hopper users can also UPDATE the name of a cafe for some impractical reason.
